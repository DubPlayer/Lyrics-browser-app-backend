Welcome to the backend of the lyrics app!

first of all, if you want to use it, you need both projects and change the url's manually, also, replace all the tokens with yours

This code uses a library that i created, it doesn't work if you upload it to vercel, if you want the full lyrics, you need to run this locally

clone this repository and just type in console **npm install** then **node script.js**

next, the main endpoint is this one:

GET

api/genius/lyrics?q=

to search any song, you need to type after the ?q= the song that you like, if it doesn't find it, try to search the song + the artist or band
